Thrilled to introduce 𝗠𝘆𝗿𝗮, 𝗮 𝘃𝗶𝗿𝘁𝘂𝗮𝗹 𝗮𝘀𝘀𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝘁 I’ve built from scratch using 𝗛𝗧𝗠𝗟, 𝗖𝗦𝗦, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗝𝗮𝘃𝗮𝗦𝗰𝗿𝗶𝗽𝘁!

In this early phase, Myra can answer questions and perform tasks like opening YouTube, Google, and more. This project has been a fantastic learning journey, especially working with JavaScript’s 𝗦𝗽𝗲𝗲𝗰𝗵 𝗥𝗲𝗰𝗼𝗴𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗦𝗽𝗲𝗲𝗰𝗵 𝗦𝘆𝗻𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘀𝗶𝘀 𝗔𝗣𝗜𝘀. It’s truly amazing to see the power of JavaScript in action! 💡✨

While there’s still a lot to improve and add, I’m excited about what’s to come. Check out the project by following link : https://virtual-assistant-myra-by-nitya.netlify.app
